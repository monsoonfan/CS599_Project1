CS599 Project 1

------------------
Implementation of Project1 as per assignment spec on BBLearn

Organization:
------------
- This code is organized into functions, with an eye to the future in hopes to use these functions later
- Would have included these functions in the form of a myLib.h, but my understanding is the assignment forbids such libraries
- Will use camelCase variable and function conventions for this project
- The use of global variables will be employed to ease implementation

Functions:
